## Nicolas Bermejo

I am an energetic and ambitious **Full Stack Junior Developer**, looking for a role where I can consolidate and extend my programming knowledge

I graduated from Oxford Brookes University in Business Management followed by several work experiences in Marketing at Editis, Data Management at Autorigin and Business Development at Schillings LLP. After leaving my last job, I spent time back in my home country and started learning to code at Makers Academy, a 16 week coding bootcamp.

## Skills

#### Communication

During my time at Editis I was doing POS marketing which required me to have constant relations with suppliers and clients. While at Schillings, I was doing data analysis for the Board which trained my written communications skills.

#### Adaptability

Having moved countries and educational systems several times in my life, I have had to adapt quickly to different situations. The same is true in my work experiences where I have worked in different countries, but also in very different roles from marketing, to data crunching, to business dev. The ability to adapt and be a fast learner is a skill I intend to keep and hone.

#### Analytical thinker

In my role at Autorigin where I needed to work with a large amount of car recall data for all Europe, I had to come up with efficient solutions to translate raw, heterogeneous Data into an organised database. While at Schillings I spent most of my time working with our CRM to deliver Market/Client analysis to the Board.
